Please act as a code formatter for [R/Python] bioinformatics code. Take the following code and refactor it to improve its readability and maintainability. **Use English**.Organize the code into logical sections with clear headers, such as:



#----------------

# Section Name

#----------------



Common section names include:

- Package Load / Import necessary modules

- Data Input

- Major Analysis Tasks

- Plotting / Visualization

- Data Output



Within each section, add comments to explain what the code is doing. Ensure that the rewritten code maintains the same functionality as the original and is easy to read and understand. If some sections are not applicable to the given code, omit them. Use the structure and style similar to the examples provided, where sections are clearly marked with comments and each part of the code is explained.Â 



**Note**

1. Some of the code's task execution and visualization are at cross-purposes, requiring you to re-separate the tasks and visualization as much as possible before organizing them separately together.

2. If there is no data output/save in the code, generate a suitable data output/sav code.
