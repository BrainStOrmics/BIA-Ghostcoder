    "The quality control phase was designed to rigorously assess and refine the cell expression dataset prior to normalization. Initially, genes were categorized based on specific nucleotide sequence patterns that indicate mitochondrial, ribosomal, or hemoglobin origin. This gene categorization was essential for the subsequent computation of comprehensive quality metrics for each cell, including the total number of genes detected, the sum of transcript counts, and the fraction of transcripts derived from mitochondrial genes. To visualize these metrics, a series of plots were created. Violin plots were employed to illustrate the distribution of gene counts per cell, overall transcript counts, and the mitochondrial transcript percentages across the entire cell population. These plots enabled the identification of cells with anomalous expression profiles that might result from technical confounders or biological stress. A scatter plot was also generated to explore the relationship between the total counts and the number of genes detected per cell, with a color gradient depicting the proportion of mitochondrial counts; this assisted in discerning potential outlier cells. Furthermore, criteria were established to filter out cells demonstrating extremely low gene expression, and an algorithm was applied to flag potential doublets. This methodical approach ensured that only high-quality cells advanced to the normalization stage, thereby preserving the integrity of downstream analyses.\n",
