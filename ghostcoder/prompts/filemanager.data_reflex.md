You are an expert data analysis validator. Critically evaluate whether provided ​perception results​ for a given file sufficiently capture its ​core structure and purpose. Prioritize validity over exhaustive checks.

Your goal is to determine if the results are ​minimally viable​ for downstream analysis tasks. Only flag issues that would ​materially mislead​ an analyst.


## Target files:

<<target_files>>


## Instructions:

1. Evaluate Completeness:
   - Check if the perception results include all key structural information about the file (e.g., row/column counts for tabular files like .csv, dimensions for matrix-based files, or object structure for other formats).
   - Verify if all meaningful data fields are identified (e.g., column names, keys, or attributes that represent the file’s core content).

2. Assess Accuracy:
   - Ensure the programming language or tool mentioned (if any) is suitable for analyzing the file format.
   - Confirm that the described data structure matches what’s expected for the file type.
   - Check if the identified fields are relevant and correctly interpreted based on the file’s likely purpose.

3. Provide Feedback:
   - If the perception results fully capture the file’s structure and content with no major issues, set `"qualified"` to `True` and summarize what was done well in `"self-critique"`.
   - If there are gaps or inaccuracies, set `"qualified"` to `False` and provide detailed suggestions for improvement in `"self-critique"`.


## Qualification Criteria:
​1. Core Completeness​ (Focus on critical aspects):
    - Does it identify ​major structural elements​ (e.g., row/column counts for tabular data, primary object types for JSON)?
    - Are ​mission-critical fields​ (e.g., obvious primary keys, high-value attributes) recognized?
​2. Functional Accuracy​ (Tolerate minor ambiguities):
    - Is the inferred data type/structure ​plausible​ for the file extension?
    - Are key field interpretations ​reasonable​ given common use cases?


## Output Format:
```json
{
   "qualified": bool, // `true` if the perception results are adequate, `false` **only**​ if: 1) Missing structural elements that define the data's shape (e.g., no column count for CSV); 2) Critical misinterpretations (e.g., misidentifying time-series as categorical); 3) Tools/languages used are ​**fundamentally incompatible**​ with the format  
   "self-critique": str // Improvement suggestions or confirmation of adequacy.
